Issue:
There are many seasons that sales are significantly higher or lower than averages. If the company does not know about these seasons, it can lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most crucial plans for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for calculating revenue and deciding to make a new investment.

Purpose:
My purpose in this project is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model, Walmart authorities can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks, calculating revenue, and determining whether to make new investments.
